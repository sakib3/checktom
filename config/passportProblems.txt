[14:59:12] Patrick: Man facebook is a pain in the butt,
so appearently they decide that some emails are invalid after x amount of time,
or if they dont respond to spam. and so they mark them as invalid,
and they wont be returned via graph/oauth/anything.
the only solution is to then use the "custom" email facebook creates for these users,
which is their facebookId@facebook.com

So solving this issue by checking if the email field exists,
and if it doesn't. I just create a facebook id for them.

Gonna see if i can find a way to test the signup with an actual working email account.
