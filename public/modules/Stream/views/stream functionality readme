Page loads: And all articles are fetched from the database and displayed in the stream. We can modify this "first" pull from the DB

Searching for articles:
1 the search input field takes a keyword
2 if distance has not been touched, there will be no filtering of results by distance.
3 results will be built on the homepage by emptying the dom list, and building articles one by one.

The unspoken stuff
1 There is no way to disable distance filter once you've "clicked" it.
